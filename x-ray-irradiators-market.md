<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Irradiators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Image Guided X-ray Irradiators</li><li>Cabinet X-ray Irradiators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>X-ray irradiators are devices used to administer controlled doses of radiation for various purposes. There are two main types of X-ray irradiators: image-guided X-ray irradiators and cabinet X-ray irradiators. Image-guided X-ray irradiators utilize imaging technology to precisely target the area in need of treatment, offering a more focused and accurate delivery of radiation. On the other hand, cabinet X-ray irradiators are enclosed devices that emit radiation uniformly, making them suitable for irradiating samples or objects within a controlled environment. Both types of X-ray irradiators serve different purposes but contribute to advancements in research and medical treatments involving radiation.</p></p>
