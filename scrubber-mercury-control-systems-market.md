<p><strong>The Scrubber Mercury Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Control System</li><li>Wet Control System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Scrubber mercury control systems are used to remove mercury emissions from industrial exhaust gases. There are two main types of these systems: dry control systems and wet control systems. Dry control systems use adsorbents or catalysts to capture and remove mercury from the gas stream. Wet control systems, on the other hand, utilize liquid-based solutions, such as activated carbon or chemical reagents, to absorb or oxidize mercury. Both types of systems aim to reduce mercury pollution for a cleaner and healthier environment.</p></p>
