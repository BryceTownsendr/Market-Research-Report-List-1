<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Selective Herbicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Paraquat</li><li>Glyphosate</li><li>Diquat</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-selective herbicides are a type of herbicide that targets and kills all types of plants without distinction. Paraquat, glyphosate, and diquat are some common types of non-selective herbicides. Paraquat is highly toxic and kills plants upon contact, while glyphosate is a widely used herbicide that disrupts plant growth. Diquat is another contact herbicide that acts quickly in killing plants. Other non-selective herbicides may include glufosinate and pelargonic acid. These herbicides are effective in controlling all vegetation, making them suitable for applications such as clearing weeds in non-crop areas or preparing fields for planting.</p></p>
