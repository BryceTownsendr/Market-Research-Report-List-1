<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X Ray Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intraoral X-rays</li><li>Extraoral X-rays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental x-ray sensors refer to devices used in the field of dentistry to capture digital images of teeth and oral structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. There are two main types of dental x-ray sensors - intraoral x-rays and extraoral x-rays. Intraoral x-rays are taken within the patient's mouth and provide detailed images of individual teeth, supporting structures, and dental abnormalities. Extraoral x-rays, on the other hand, capture images outside the mouth and are primarily used to study the skull, jaw, and surrounding areas.</p></p>
