<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Microvascular Clips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disposable microvascular clips are commonly used in microvascular surgery to occlude blood vessels temporarily or permanently. They are available in two types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable clips are made of materials that break down or get absorbed over time by the body, eliminating the need for removal. Non-absorbable clips, on the other hand, are made of materials that do not break down and need to be removed after healing. Both types offer durability and reliable hemostasis, but it's essential for surgeons to choose the appropriate type based on the specific surgical requirements.</p></p>
