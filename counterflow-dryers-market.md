<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Counterflow Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Dryer</li><li>Continuous Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Counterflow dryers are a type of drying equipment used to remove moisture from agricultural, industrial, or other materials. The batch dryer is a type of counterflow dryer where the material to be dried is loaded in batches and dried in separate cycles. This type is suitable for small-scale operations. In contrast, continuous dryers handle a constant flow of material through the drying process, making them more suitable for large-scale operations. Both types of dryers facilitate efficient drying by directing the material against the airflow, maximizing heat transfer and reducing drying time.</p></p>
