<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Outdoor Stride Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Induced</li><li>Vibration Induced</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The outdoor stride sensor market can be categorized into two types: gravity-induced and vibration-induced. Gravity-induced sensors rely on the principle of acceleration due to gravity to measure a runner's stride length and cadence. They typically consist of a small device attached to the runner's shoe, which calculates the movement based on changes in gravitational forces. On the other hand, vibration-induced sensors use vibrations generated during the footstrike to capture data and provide insights on stride metrics. Both types offer valuable information for athletes and fitness enthusiasts to improve their running performance and technique.</p></p>
