<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electronic Throttle Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive Sensor Type</li><li>Magnetic Sensor Type</li><li>Inductive Sensor Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS) market includes three main types of sensors used in the system: resistive, magnetic, and inductive sensors. </p><p>Resistive Sensor Type: This type uses a resistive element that changes its resistance based on the position of the throttle. As the throttle is opened or closed, the resistance value changes, allowing the system to monitor and control the engine's airflow and fuel injection accordingly.</p><p>Magnetic Sensor Type: This type utilizes a magnetic field to detect the position of the throttle. As the throttle moves, a magnetic sensor detects the changes in the magnetic field, enabling precise measurement of throttle position and accurate control of the engine.</p><p>Inductive Sensor Type: This type employs an inductive coil to detect the throttle position. When the throttle moves, the coil generates an electric current that varies with the position change. This information is then used to regulate the engine's performance, ensuring optimal fuel efficiency and power output.</p></p>
