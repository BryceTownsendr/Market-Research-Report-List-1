<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phase-locked Dielectric Resonator Oscillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Loop</li><li>Double Loop</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Phase-locked Dielectric Resonator Oscillators (DROs) can be classified into two types: Single Loop and Double Loop. In a Single Loop DRO, a feedback loop is used to stabilize the output frequency by adjusting the tuning voltage. It ensures stable oscillation but may have limited frequency range. On the other hand, a Double Loop DRO incorporates an additional tuning loop that allows for wider frequency range and better frequency stability. This type of DRO is more complex but provides improved performance for applications requiring a wider frequency range.</p></p>
