<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Matting Agents for Paint & Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Matting Agents</li><li>Inorganic Matting Agents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Matting agents are additives used in paint and coating formulations to create a matte or dull appearance on surfaces. There are two main types: organic matting agents and inorganic matting agents. Organic matting agents are derived from natural or synthetic materials and help to lower the gloss level of paints and coatings. Inorganic matting agents, on the other hand, are made from minerals and provide a more uniform and consistent matting effect. Both types offer different properties and are chosen based on the desired finish and performance requirements.</p></p>
