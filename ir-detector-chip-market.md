<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IR Detector Chip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled Type</li><li>Uncooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>IR detector chip market can be divided into two types: cooled type and uncooled type. The cooled type of IR detector chip requires a cooling mechanism, usually using liquid nitrogen or a thermoelectric cooler, to operate effectively. This type offers higher sensitivity and accuracy but is expensive and bulky. On the other hand, the uncooled type does not require any cooling mechanism, making it smaller and more cost-effective. Although it provides lower sensitivity and accuracy compared to the cooled type, it is widely used in applications where size and cost are crucial factors.</p></p>
