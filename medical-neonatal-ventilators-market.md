<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Medical neonatal ventilators are devices used to provide respiratory support to newborn babies who are incapable of breathing on their own. The market for these ventilators can be categorized into two types â€“ invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of an endotracheal tube inserted into the baby's airway to assist with breathing. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support through various interfaces like nasal masks or prongs, without the need for intubation. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring proper respiratory function in neonates.</p></p>
