<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-flooded Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Screw Compressor</li><li>Reciprocating Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oil-flooded compressors are categorized into two main types: rotary screw compressors and reciprocating compressors. Rotary screw compressors work by using two interlocking screws to compress air, making them ideal for continuous operation and high-volume applications. Reciprocating compressors use pistons to compress air in a back-and-forth motion, making them suitable for low to medium air volume requirements. Both types require oil for lubrication and cooling purposes. However, rotary screw compressors are more commonly used due to their higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and quieter operation.</p></p>
