<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer’s Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinergic</li><li>Memantine</li><li>CombinedDrug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's drugs market is divided into three types: cholinergic drugs, memantine, and combined drugs. Cholinergic drugs work by increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain to improve memory and cognitive function. Memantine, on the other hand, is an NMDA receptor antagonist that helps regulate the activity of glutamate, a chemical involved in learning and memory processes. Combined drugs are a combination of cholinergic and memantine drugs, aiming to provide a dual mechanism of action for better treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p></p>
