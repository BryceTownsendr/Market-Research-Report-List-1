<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unified Threat Management Firewall Hardware Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Routing Working Mode</li><li>Transparent Working Mode</li><li>Mixed Working Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Unified Threat Management Firewall Hardware market consists of three types of working modes: routing, transparent, and mixed. In routing working mode, the firewall hardware is placed between the network and the device, actively routing the traffic and inspecting it for threats. In transparent working mode, the firewall hardware is inline with the network but remains transparent to network devices, silently monitoring and filtering the traffic. Mixed working mode combines features of both routing and transparent modes, providing flexibility to choose between them based on network requirements.</p></p>
