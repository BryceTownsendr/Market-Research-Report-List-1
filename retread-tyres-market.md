<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retread Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retread tires are categorized into two main types: pre-cure and mold cure. Pre-cure tires involve the application of a pre-cured rubber tread to a previously buffed and prepared tire casing. This process is commonly used for truck tires and offers enhanced tread life and traction. On the other hand, mold cure tires involve a new tread being applied to the buffed tire casing using an uncured rubber compound. This method is popular for passenger car tires and provides improved durability and performance. Both types offer cost-effective alternatives to purchasing new tires.</p></p>
