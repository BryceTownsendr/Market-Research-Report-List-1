<p><strong>The Head-Up-Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Projector</li><li>Combiner</li><li>Video Generator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Head-Up-Display (HUD) market comprises three main types of technologies: Projector HUDs, Combiner HUDs, and Video Generator HUDs. Projector HUDs use a small projector to display information directly onto the windshield or a separate screen in the driver's line of sight. Combiner HUDs combine information from the display panel with the outside view, projecting it onto a transparent combiner lens. Video Generator HUDs, on the other hand, generate a video feed that is projected onto the windshield. Each of these types of HUDs offers slightly different features and functionalities to enhance the driving experience.</p></p>
