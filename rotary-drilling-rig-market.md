<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Rig Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crawler</li><li>Rubber-Tired</li><li>Not Applicable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drilling rigs are classified into three main types: crawler, rubber-tired, and not applicable. Crawler rigs are equipped with tracks, allowing them to move easily over rough terrains, making them suitable for off-road drilling operations. Rubber-tired rigs have wheels instead of tracks, making them more maneuverable, especially on paved surfaces. The not applicable category refers to rigs that do not fall into the crawler or rubber-tired categories, such as fixed-platform rigs or offshore drilling units. These rigs are specifically designed for their respective environments and drilling purposes.</p></p>
