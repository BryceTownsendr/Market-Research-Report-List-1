<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Harmonic Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Filters</li><li>Active Filters</li><li>Hybrid Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Advanced harmonic filters are used to reduce harmonic distortion in power systems. There are three main types: passive filters, active filters, and hybrid filters. Passive filters use capacitors and inductors to absorb and reduce harmonic currents. Active filters, on the other hand, use power electronics to generate harmonic currents that cancel out the harmonics produced by nonlinear loads. Hybrid filters combine both passive and active filter technology to provide better harmonic reduction. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific application.</p></p>
