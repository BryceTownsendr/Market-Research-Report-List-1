<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propeller Shaft Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disk Brakes</li><li>Calliper Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The propeller shaft brakes market includes two types: disk brakes and caliper brakes. Disk brakes consist of a rotor that rotates with the propeller shaft and a stationary caliper that houses brake pads. When the brakes are applied, the caliper applies pressure to the pads, which press against the rotor, slowing down or stopping the propeller shaft's rotation. On the other hand, caliper brakes use a clamp-like caliper to squeeze brake pads against the rotating propeller shaft, reducing or halting its movement.</p></p>
