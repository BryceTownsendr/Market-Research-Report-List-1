<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminar Flow Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Laminar Flow Hood</li><li>Vertical Laminar Flow Hood</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laminar Flow Hood is a type of controlled environment equipment used in laboratories and cleanrooms to provide a sterile work area. Horizontal Laminar Flow Hood directs clean air horizontally towards the user, preventing contamination from above. Vertical Laminar Flow Hood, on the other hand, directs clean air from the top of the work area downwards, creating a vertical laminar flow. Both types effectively remove contaminants and provide a sterile environment, but their direction of airflow differs. The choice between horizontal and vertical depends on the specific requirements and nature of the work being performed.</p></p>
