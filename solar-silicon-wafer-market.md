<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Silicon Wafer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Crystal Silicon Wafer</li><li>Polycrystalline Silicon Wafer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar silicon wafer market consists of two major types: single crystal silicon wafer and polycrystalline silicon wafer. Single crystal silicon wafers are made from a single crystal lattice structure, resulting in higher purity and efficiency. They are more expensive to produce but offer better electrical properties. On the other hand, polycrystalline silicon wafers are made from multiple crystal grains, making them less pure and efficient than single crystal wafers but more cost-effective. Both types are essential in the production of solar cells for harnessing solar energy.</p></p>
