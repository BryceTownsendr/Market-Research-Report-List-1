<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Radiosynthesis Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automated</li><li>Semi-Automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated radiosynthesis modules can be classified into two main types - fully automated and semi-automated. Fully automated modules are capable of performing all steps of the radiosynthesis process without human intervention, from precursor loading to purification. They offer high efficiency, precision, and reproducibility. On the other hand, semi-automated modules require some level of human intervention during certain steps of the process, such as precursor purification or manual adjustments. While they may offer more flexibility, they can be less time-efficient and may have a higher risk of human error.</p></p>
