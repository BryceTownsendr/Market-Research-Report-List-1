<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cutting Electrosurgical Unit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Electrosurgery</li><li>Monopolar Electrosurgery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The cutting electrosurgical unit market consists of two types: bipolar electrosurgery and monopolar electrosurgery. In bipolar electrosurgery, the electric current flows between two electrodes within the surgical instrument, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues. Monopolar electrosurgery, on the other hand, uses a single electrode to deliver the current, which requires the use of a grounding pad to complete the circuit. Both types offer different benefits and are used in various surgical procedures, providing surgeons with options for cutting tissue effectively and safely.</p></p>
