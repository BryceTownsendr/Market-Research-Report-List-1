<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fibre Veil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Netting Process</li><li>Dry Netting Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glass fibre veil market is segmented into two types: wet netting process and dry netting process. In the wet netting process, glass fibre is formed into a mat by spraying liquid resin onto a carrier material called netting. This process ensures better adhesion and impregnation of the resin into the fibres, resulting in enhanced strength and durability. On the other hand, the dry netting process involves applying resin powder to the glass fibres coated with a bonding agent. This method offers ease of handling and cost-effectiveness. Both processes contribute to the diverse applications of glass fibre veils across various industries.</p></p>
