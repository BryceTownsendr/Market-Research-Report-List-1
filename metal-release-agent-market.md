<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent</li><li>Semi-permanent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal release agents are chemical substances used in various industries to prevent adhesion of metal parts to casting molds or other metal surfaces. There are two main types of metal release agents: permanent and semi-permanent. Permanent release agents create a long-lasting and durable barrier between the metal surface and the mold, offering exceptional release properties even after multiple uses. On the other hand, semi-permanent release agents provide temporary barriers that must be reapplied after a certain number of uses, offering less long-term durability but easier application and removal.</p></p>
